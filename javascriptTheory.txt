Javascript is a synchronous single-threaded language.
Everything in javascript happens inside an execution context.

var n=2;
function square(num){--> here num is called argument
    var ans= num*num;
    return ans;
}
var square2 = square(n)--> here n is parameter,in this line i am invoking the square function

Javascript has its own call stack, in the bottom it has the global execution context.
Supposse it has its first execution context is E1, it will put upon global execution context. 
Once E1 executes,the control goes over the global execution context. this way javascript code executes.

Call stack maintains the order of execution of execution context.

window -->it is an global object created by javascript along with execution context
